# Security Policy

Thank you for taking the time to investigate the security of MLA. The security
of MLA is our topmost priority. We appreciate investigative work into system
security by well-intentioned, ethical security researchers. If you discover a
vulnerability, however small, we would like to know about it to address it with
appropriate measures as quickly as possible. This document outlines the method
we use to work with the security research community to address runtime security.

## Reporting a vulnerability

Please open a new [Security advisory](https://github.com/ANSSI-FR/MLA/security/advisories/new) with your findings. Alternatively, if you wish to report anonymously, you can send an email to `club@ssi.gouv.fr`. We strive to resolve all problems as quickly as possible. If appropriate, we may assist in the publication of writeups after the problem is resolved.

Try to include as much information as possible in the initial report, so we can
quickly address the issue.

**Please do not open security issues in the public issue tracker.**

### Please do the following

- Do not take advantage of the vulnerability or problem you have discovered.
- Do not publish or reveal the problem until it has been resolved.
- Do not use attacks on physical security or applications of third parties.
- Do provide sufficient information to reproduce the problem, so we will be able
  to resolve it as quickly as possible. Usually, a list of steps to follow, and
  the vulnerable MLA version is enough. More complex vulnerabilities may
  require further explanation.

### Our commitment to you

- If you act in accordance with this policy, we will not take legal action
  against you in regard to your report.
- We will handle your report with strict confidentiality, and not pass on your
  personal details to third parties without your permission.
