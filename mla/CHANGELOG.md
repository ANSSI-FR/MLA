## [1.1.0] - 2021-01-26

### Thanks

- [Matthieu Buffet](https://github.com/mtth-bfft)

### Added/Changed

- C/CPP bindings (for archive writing), and associated tests

  * `libmla.a` for Linux x86-64 bits;
  * `mla.lib` (static), `mla.dll` + `mla.dll.lib` (dynamic), `mla.pdb` (symbols) for Windows i686 and x86_64, in *release* and *debug* targets.
